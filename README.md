# Crystal Collector

### How to Play!
A random number between 19-120 is generated at the beginning of the game and is displayed in the top left. This is your target number.

There are four crystals, each assigned a random value between 1-12. Clicking on a crystal will add the value of that crystal to your score, which is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

The user wins the game by matching the value of their score to the target number. The user loses if they go over the target number.

When the user either wins or loses a game, a new target number is generated and new values are assigned to each crystal. Wins and loses are tracked along the way!
